# FPGA-Based-AI-Accelerator-SPI

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: FPGA AI Accelerator with SPI Communication

This project develops an AI accelerator on an FPGA, utilizing SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) for communication with an external host (CPU/GPU/MCU). The FPGA will perform neural network inference, receiving input data and transmitting results via SPI.

**Key Objectives:**

* Design an FPGA-based AI accelerator capable of running lightweight neural networks.
* Implement SPI communication to facilitate data transfer between the FPGA and a host device.
* Optimize the system for low-power AI applications.

**Project Architecture:**

* **Host Device:** Sends input data (e.g., image, sensor data) to the FPGA via SPI and receives AI inference results.
* **FPGA AI Accelerator:** Executes neural network inference, utilizing DSP blocks for acceleration. Stores model weights in external memory.
* **SPI Communication:** Establishes data exchange between the host and FPGA.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  Design and implement the SPI slave interface on the FPGA.
2.  Deploy a simple AI model onto the FPGA.
3.  Implement the SPI master interface on the host device.
4.  Test and validate the integrated system.

**Possible Enhancements:**

* Explore QSPI for increased data transfer speeds.
* Implement more complex CNN accelerators.
* Integrate DMA for high-speed data transfer.

**Goal:**

The primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of using SPI for efficient data exchange in FPGA-based AI acceleration, enabling low-power and embedded AI applications.
